The main task of this project is to perform analysis of Facebook ad campaign data and optimise sales conversion. We then use these campaign results to predict future sales. The objective is to analyse the factors that influence sales such as 
ad impressions, 
number of clicks and cost for each click etc and 
create a predictive model that can be applied to optimise future ad campaigns. 
The project involves tasks like loading the dataset, performing preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and developing machine learning models for sales prediction.

Later we have used Streamlit Cloud to deploy the model.
