# Visualising the Social Media Sales Prediction & Ad-Campaign Analysis

## Project Description

This project focuses on visualizing social media sales prediction and ad-campaign analysis. The goal is to analyze Facebook ad campaign data, optimize sales conversion, and predict future sales based on the campaign results. The project involves tasks such as loading and preprocessing the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis, training machine learning models for sales prediction, and deploying a web application.

## Domain

The project falls under the domain of digital marketing, which involves the use of digital channels such as search engines, social media, and email marketing. The three-step process in this domain includes targeting specific customer bases, reaching out to them through various means of communication, and optimizing conversion rates to drive sales.

## Data Abstraction

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Facebook's social media ad campaign. It is a CSV file containing 11 columns and 1143 data points. The dataset includes attributes such as ad_id, campaign_id, age, gender, interests, impressions, clicks, spent, and total conversion.

## Task Abstraction

The main task of this project is to analyze the Facebook ad campaign data and optimize sales conversion. The specific actions involved are:

1. Loading and preprocessing the dataset
2. Performing exploratory data analysis
3. Training machine learning models for sales prediction
4. Evaluating the model performance
5. Enhancing the model based on the obtained results and gaining insights for sales prediction

## Implementation using Tools

The following tools and libraries are used for implementing the project:

- Pandas: For loading and preprocessing the dataset
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization
- Scikit-learn: For training machine learning models
- Streamlit: For web application deployment

## Results from Analysis

In this part of the project, we focused on performing exploratory data analysis on the dataset. Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries, we generated various visualizations and gained insights from the data.

Here are some of the insights we obtained:

Here are some of the insights we obtained:

- The most common age group targeted in the ad campaign is between 25-34 years.
- Females tend to have a higher conversion rate compared to males.
- Ad campaigns targeting specific interests such as 'Sports', 'Travel', and 'Fashion' show a higher conversion rate.
- There is a positive correlation between the amount spent on ads and the number of clicks received.
